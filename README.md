_Node.js project_

#### Buffered binary reader with a fluent api ####

Version: 0.0.1, not yet!!!!!

The BinaryReader is a wrapper around the `fs.read()` function. It has an internal buffer that maintains the last chunk of data read from disk, so it minimizes the number of i/o calls. If the requested data is already in the buffer it doesn't perform any i/o call and the data is copied from the buffer. It also implements a fluent interface for your ease.

#### Installation ####

```
npm install binary-reader
```

__What are its uses?__

Anything that reads binary files. These are the benefits you'll win:

- Read big binary files without caring about how to retrieve the data and without implementing your own internal cursor system.
- Avoids the callback nesting. It uses a very lightweight asynchronous control flow library: [deferred-queue](https://github.com/gagle/node-deferred-queue).
- Eases the error handling.
- It is lazy! Delays the open and read calls until they are necessary, ie. `br.open(file).close()` does nothing.

__How it works?__

To make the things easier there are 5 cases depending on the buffer position and the range of the bytes that you want to read. These cases only apply if the buffer size is smaller than the file size, otherwise the file is stored into memory, so only one i/o call is done.

Suppose a buffer size of 5 bytes (green background).  
The pointer `p` is the cursor and it points to the first byte.  
The pointer `e` is the end and it points to the last byte.  
The `x` bytes are not into memory. They need to be read from disk.  
The `y` bytes are already into memory. No need to read them again.

For simplicity, the `x` group of bytes will be less than a buffer size so they can be read with a single i/o call. The binary reader takes cares of this and makes all the necessary calls to read all the `x` bytes.

___module_.open(path[, options]) : Reader__

Returns a new `Reader`.

__Reader__

The Reader uses a fluent interface. The way to go is to chain the operations synchronously and, after all, close the file. They will be executed in order and asynchronously. If any error occurs an `error` event is fired, the pending operations are cancelled and the file is closed automatically.

The `read()` and `seek()` functions receive a callback. This callback is executed after the current operation and before the next one. If you do any job inside this callback and it returns an error you should stop and close the reader because the next operations will be executed automatically. You cannot use `close()` because it is enqueued and awaits its turn. To stop the queue execution immediately you must use the `cancel()` function. The reader will be closed automatically. For example:

```javascript
var r = br.open ("...")
		.on ("error", function (error){
			console.error (error);
		})
		.on ("close", function (){
			//doSomething() has failed so it cancels the reader and closes the file
			//The second read is not executed
			//Proceed with other tasks
		})
		.read (5, function (cb){
			doSomething (function (error){
				if (error){
					console.error (error);
					r.cancel ();
				}else{
					//Proceed with the next read
					//Any error returned by external functions has nothing to do with the
					//errors generated by the reader, that's why the error is not passed
					//to the completion callback
					cb ();
				}
			})
		})
		.read (10, function (){
			...
		})
		.close ();
```
